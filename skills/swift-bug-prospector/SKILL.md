# Bug Prospector

> **Quick Ref:** Find bugs that pattern-based scanners miss by analyzing _intent_, not syntax. Output: `.agents/research/YYYY-MM-DD-bug-prospector-*.md`

**YOU MUST EXECUTE THIS WORKFLOW. Do not just describe it.**

**Required output:** Every BUG finding MUST include Urgency, Risk, ROI, and Blast Radius ratings using the Issue Rating Table format. Do not omit these ratings.

**Philosophy:** Auditing tools find what's _syntactically wrong_. Bug Prospector finds what's _semantically fragile_ — the gap between "the code compiles" and "the code handles every real-world scenario."

---

## Pre-flight: Git Safety Check

```bash
git status --short
```

If uncommitted changes exist:

```
AskUserQuestion with questions:
[
  {
    "question": "You have uncommitted changes. Commit before proceeding?",
    "header": "Git",
    "options": [
      {"label": "Commit first (Recommended)", "description": "Save current work so you can revert if this skill modifies files"},
      {"label": "Continue without committing", "description": "Proceed — I accept the risk"}
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }
]
```

If "Commit first": Ask for a commit message, stage changed files, and commit. Then proceed.

### Freshness

Base all findings on current source code only. Do not read or reference files in `.agents/`, `scratch/`, or prior audit reports. Ignore cached findings from auto-memory or previous sessions. Every finding must come from scanning the actual codebase as it exists now.

---

## Step 1: Choose Scope and Lenses

### 1.1: Determine Scope

```
AskUserQuestion with questions:
[
  {
    "question": "What should I prospect?",
    "header": "Scope",
    "options": [
      {"label": "Specific file or feature", "description": "I'll tell you which file(s) or feature to analyze"},
      {"label": "Recently changed files", "description": "Analyze files changed in the last 5 commits"},
      {"label": "Full codebase", "description": "Broad scan across all source files (slower, more thorough)"}
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }
]
```

**If "Specific file or feature":** Ask which file(s) or feature name.

**If "Recently changed files":**

```bash
git diff --name-only HEAD~5 -- "*.swift" | head -30
```

**If "Full codebase":** Use `Glob pattern="**/*.swift"` to inventory, then prioritize:

1. ViewModels and Managers (business logic)
2. Data layer (persistence, sync, networking)
3. Views with complex state (forms, multi-step flows)
4. Skip: pure layout views, previews, test files

### 1.2: Choose Lenses

```
AskUserQuestion with questions:
[
  {
    "question": "Which analysis lenses should I apply?",
    "header": "Lenses",
    "options": [
      {"label": "All 7 lenses (Recommended)", "description": "Full prospecting — assumptions, state machines, boundaries, data lifecycle, error paths, time, platform"},
      {"label": "Quick 3", "description": "Assumptions + Error Paths + Boundaries — highest bug yield"},
      {"label": "Let me pick", "description": "I'll choose specific lenses"}
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }
]
```

**If "Let me pick":**

```
AskUserQuestion with questions:
[
  {
    "question": "Select the lenses to apply:",
    "header": "Lenses",
    "options": [
      {"label": "1. Assumption Audit", "description": "List every implicit assumption and what breaks when violated"},
      {"label": "2. State Machine Analysis", "description": "Find unreachable states, simultaneous states, interrupted transitions"},
      {"label": "3. Boundary Conditions", "description": "Zero, one, max values; empty strings; nil chains; off-by-one"},
      {"label": "4. Data Lifecycle Tracing", "description": "Follow data from creation to deletion — find gaps"}
    ],
    "multiSelect": true
  },
  {
    "question": "Additional lenses:",
    "header": "More",
    "options": [
      {"label": "5. Error Path Exerciser", "description": "What happens when every try/catch and optional chain fails?"},
      {"label": "6. Time-Dependent Bugs", "description": "Timezone, locale, rapid actions, slow network, first launch after weeks"},
      {"label": "7. Platform Divergence", "description": "Hardware assumptions, OS version gaps, device-specific behavior"}
    ],
    "multiSelect": true
  }
]
```

---

## Step 2: Execute Selected Lenses

For each file in scope, apply the selected lenses. Read the full file before analysis — never analyze from grep matches alone.

### Lens 1: Assumption Audit

**Goal:** Surface every implicit assumption the code makes, then evaluate what happens when each is violated.

**Process:**

1. Read the file completely
2. For every function/computed property, list assumptions such as:
   - "This array will always have at least one element"
   - "This network call will complete before the view disappears"
   - "The user will have iCloud enabled"
   - "This date string will always be in ISO 8601 format"
   - "This dictionary key will always exist"
   - "The parent view will always pass a non-nil value"
   - "This enum will never have new cases added"
3. For each assumption, determine:
   - **How likely is violation?** (Never / Rare / Occasional / Common)
   - **What happens on violation?** (Crash / Silent data loss / Wrong UI / Graceful degradation)
   - **Is there a guard?** (Yes — handled / No — unprotected)
4. Flag as BUG if: likelihood >= Rare AND consequence >= Silent data loss AND no guard

**Search accelerators** (grep for common assumption patterns):

```
Grep pattern="\.first!" glob="**/*.swift"
Grep pattern="\.last!" glob="**/*.swift"
Grep pattern="\[0\]" glob="**/*.swift"
Grep pattern="\.removeFirst\(\)" glob="**/*.swift"
Grep pattern="as!" glob="**/*.swift"
```

### Lens 2: State Machine Analysis

**Goal:** Find states that become unreachable, states that can be simultaneously active, and transitions that leave the app in an inconsistent state.

**Process:**

1. Identify all `@State`, `@Published`, `@Observable` properties that represent user-facing state
2. Map the state transitions:
   - Draw the state graph: which states lead to which?
   - Can any state become a dead end? (entered but never exited)
   - Can two mutually exclusive states be true simultaneously?
3. Check interruption resilience:
   - What happens if the user backgrounds the app mid-transition?
   - What happens if a sheet is dismissed during an async operation?
   - What happens if the view disappears before a Task completes?
4. Check reset paths:
   - After an error, does state reset to a usable starting point?
   - After cancellation, are all intermediate states cleaned up?

**Search accelerators:**

```
Grep pattern="@State.*=.*true" glob="**/*.swift"
Grep pattern="@Published.*=.*true" glob="**/*.swift"
Grep pattern="isLoading|isProcessing|isSaving|isAnalyzing" glob="**/*.swift"
Grep pattern="showingError|showingAlert|showingSheet" glob="**/*.swift"
```

### Lens 3: Boundary Conditions

**Goal:** Find off-by-one errors, empty collection crashes, and edge case failures.

**Process:**

1. For every conditional (`if`, `guard`, `switch`), evaluate:
   - **Zero:** What happens with 0 items, empty string, nil?
   - **One:** What happens with exactly 1 item? (Singular/plural, first==last)
   - **Maximum:** What happens at Int.max, massive arrays, very long strings?
   - **Negative:** What happens with negative numbers where unsigned is expected?
2. For every array/collection access:
   - Is the index bounds-checked?
   - Does `removeFirst()` / `removeLast()` have an emptiness guard?
   - Does `prefix()` / `suffix()` handle count > array.count?
3. For every string operation:
   - Does it handle empty strings?
   - Does it handle Unicode (emoji, RTL, combining characters)?
   - Does it handle strings with special characters (quotes, backslashes)?

**Search accelerators:**

```
Grep pattern="\.remove(First|Last)\(\)" glob="**/*.swift"
Grep pattern="\.\[.*\]" glob="**/*.swift"
Grep pattern="\.prefix\(|\.suffix\(" glob="**/*.swift"
Grep pattern="\.split\(|\.components\(" glob="**/*.swift"
Grep pattern="Int\.max|\.count\s*-\s*1" glob="**/*.swift"
```

### Lens 4: Data Lifecycle Tracing

**Goal:** Follow data from creation to deletion and find gaps where data can be lost, duplicated, or become stale.

**Process:**

1. Pick the primary data entities (models, cached values, user input)
2. For each entity, trace:
   - **Creation:** Where is it created? What validations exist at creation time?
   - **Modification:** Where is it modified? Can modifications conflict? Are changes persisted immediately or batched?
   - **Persistence:** Where is it saved? Can the save fail silently? Is there a race between saves?
   - **Display:** Where is it displayed? Can stale data be shown after a background update?
   - **Deletion:** Where is it deleted? Are all references cleaned up? Are related entities cascaded?
   - **Sync:** If synced, what happens on conflict? Is there a "last write wins" that could lose data?
3. Flag gaps:
   - Created but never persisted (in-memory only, lost on crash)
   - Modified but UI not updated (stale display)
   - Deleted but references remain (dangling pointers, orphaned data)
   - Synced but no conflict resolution

**Search accelerators:**

```
Grep pattern="context\.insert\(" glob="**/*.swift"
Grep pattern="context\.delete\(" glob="**/*.swift"
Grep pattern="context\.save\(" glob="**/*.swift"
Grep pattern="\.deleteRule\s*=" glob="**/*.swift"
Grep pattern="@Query" glob="**/*.swift"
```

### Lens 5: Error Path Exerciser

**Goal:** For every try/catch, async/await, and optional chain — determine what happens when the error path is taken.

**Process:**

1. Find all error-producing code:
   - `try` / `try?` / `try!`
   - `await` (can throw via Task cancellation)
   - Optional chaining (`?.`)
   - `guard let ... else { return }`
2. For each error path, evaluate:
   - **Does the UI reflect the error?** Or does it show a loading state forever?
   - **Is the app left in a consistent state?** Or is it half-modified?
   - **Can the user retry?** Or are they stuck?
   - **Is the error logged?** Or silently swallowed?
3. Specifically check for:
   - `try?` that converts a meaningful error to nil (information loss)
   - `catch` blocks that log but don't update UI state
   - Missing `isLoading = false` in error paths (loading state trap)
   - `guard let` with bare `return` that silently aborts a user-initiated action
   - `Task {}` without error handling (errors vanish)

**Search accelerators:**

```
Grep pattern="try\?" glob="**/*.swift"
Grep pattern="catch\s*\{" glob="**/*.swift" -A 3
Grep pattern="guard let.*else\s*\{\s*return\s*\}" glob="**/*.swift"
Grep pattern="Task\s*\{" glob="**/*.swift" -A 5
```

### Lens 6: Time-Dependent Bugs

**Goal:** Find code that behaves differently based on time, speed, or duration.

**Process:**

1. **Timezone and locale:**
   - DateFormatters without explicit timezone set
   - Date comparisons using `<` instead of Calendar methods
   - String-to-date parsing that assumes a specific locale
   - Display of dates without considering user's locale
2. **Duration since last use:**
   - Cached data that expires but has no expiry check
   - Tokens/sessions that timeout but the app doesn't re-authenticate
   - "First launch" flags that don't account for app updates
3. **Rapid repeated actions:**
   - Buttons without debouncing that trigger duplicate network calls
   - Double-tap on save that creates duplicate records
   - Rapid navigation that crashes due to concurrent presentations
4. **Slow or absent network:**
   - Operations that assume network availability
   - Missing timeout on network requests
   - No offline fallback for features that need data
   - Optimistic UI that doesn't roll back on failure

**Search accelerators:**

```
Grep pattern="DateFormatter\(\)" glob="**/*.swift"
Grep pattern="Date\(\)" glob="**/*.swift"
Grep pattern="timeIntervalSince" glob="**/*.swift"
Grep pattern="URLSession.*dataTask\|URLSession.*data\(" glob="**/*.swift"
Grep pattern="\.debounce\|\.throttle" glob="**/*.swift"
```

### Lens 7: Platform Divergence

**Goal:** Find code that assumes specific hardware, OS version, or device capabilities.

**Process:**

1. **Hardware assumptions:**
   - Image/video processing that assumes GPU acceleration (fails on Intel Macs, old devices)
   - Memory-intensive operations without pressure checks
   - Camera/sensor access without capability checks
   - Biometric auth that assumes Face ID (could be Touch ID or neither)
2. **OS version gaps:**
   - `#available` checks where the `else` branch is incomplete or empty
   - Features gated by availability but degraded path not tested
   - API behavioral differences between OS versions (not just availability)
3. **Device-specific behavior:**
   - Screen size assumptions (hardcoded widths, missing adaptive layout)
   - Keyboard presence assumptions (iPad with hardware keyboard, Mac)
   - Rotation handling that only works on certain devices
   - Split View / Stage Manager compatibility
4. **Platform #if blocks:**
   - `#if os(iOS)` with logic not mirrored in `#else` (macOS)
   - Platform-specific features without feature detection
   - Conditional compilation where one branch is clearly less tested

**Search accelerators:**

```
Grep pattern="#if os\(" glob="**/*.swift"
Grep pattern="#available\(" glob="**/*.swift"
Grep pattern="UIScreen\.main" glob="**/*.swift"
Grep pattern="UIDevice\.current" glob="**/*.swift"
Grep pattern="ProcessInfo.*physicalMemory\|ProcessInfo.*processorCount" glob="**/*.swift"
Grep pattern="CIContext\|MTLDevice\|MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice" glob="**/*.swift"
```

## Step 3: Verification Rule

Before classifying ANY finding:

1. **Read the flagged file** — at minimum 30 lines around the issue
2. **Check for existing guards** — the assumption may already be protected
3. **Check for intentional design** — comments, documentation, or clear architectural decisions
4. **Check if it's actually reachable** — dead code or unreachable paths are not bugs
5. **Assess real-world likelihood** — theoretical issues in impossible scenarios are not bugs
6. **Count blast radius** — grep for callers/references of the affected function or property to determine how many files the fix would touch
7. **Classify** as:
   - **BUG:** Real risk, no guard, realistic scenario
   - **FRAGILE:** Works now but will break under foreseeable conditions
   - **OK:** Already guarded or intentional design
   - **REVIEW:** Unclear, needs human judgment

**Classification rules:**

- A finding is NOT a bug if the code already handles the case (even if the handling is in a different function)
- A finding is NOT a bug if the scenario requires conditions that the app's architecture prevents
- A finding IS a bug if a real user could trigger it through normal usage
- A finding is FRAGILE if it works today but depends on an assumption that could change

## Step 4: Generate Report

### 4.1: Check Terminal Width

Before rendering the report, check terminal width:

```bash
tput cols
```

- **160+ columns:** Use the **full 8-column table** inline and in the report file.
- **Under 160 columns:** Use the **compact 4-column table** inline, write the **full 8-column table** to the report file only. Display this notice after the inline table:

> **Compact view** — your terminal is [N] columns wide (160+ needed for full table). The complete Issue Rating Table with all 8 columns has been written to `.agents/research/YYYY-MM-DD-bug-prospector-<scope>.md`. Open that file or widen your terminal to 160+ columns to view it as a single table.

### 4.2: Render Report

**Display the summary and findings inline**, then write to `.agents/research/YYYY-MM-DD-bug-prospector-<scope>.md`.

The **report file** always uses the full 8-column table regardless of terminal width.

```markdown
# Bug Prospector Report: [Scope Description]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Scope:** [Files/features analyzed]
**Lenses Applied:** [List of lenses used]
**Files Analyzed:** N

## Summary

| Status               | Count |
| -------------------- | ----- |
| Bugs Found           | X     |
| Fragile Code         | Y     |
| OK (Already Guarded) | Z     |
| Needs Review         | W     |

## Issue Rating Table

All BUG and FRAGILE findings rated and sorted by Urgency then ROI:
```

**Full table (160+ columns) — used inline AND in report file:**

| #   | Finding                                              | Lens       | Urgency     | Risk: Fix | Risk: No Fix | ROI          | Blast Radius | Fix Effort |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------- | --------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ---------- |
| 1   | File.swift:45 — array accessed without bounds check  | Boundary   | 🔴 Critical | ⚪ Low    | 🔴 Critical  | 🟠 Excellent | ⚪ 1 file    | Trivial    |
| 2   | Manager.swift:89 — isLoading never reset on error    | Error Path | 🟡 High     | ⚪ Low    | 🟡 High      | 🟠 Excellent | ⚪ 1 file    | Trivial    |
| 3   | ViewModel.swift:200 — DateFormatter without timezone | Time       | 🟢 Medium   | ⚪ Low    | 🟢 Medium    | 🟢 Good      | 🟢 3 files   | Small      |

**Compact table (under 160 columns) — used inline only:**

| #   | Finding                                              | Urgency     | Fix Effort |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| 1   | File.swift:45 — array accessed without bounds check  | 🔴 Critical | Trivial    |
| 2   | Manager.swift:89 — isLoading never reset on error    | 🟡 High     | Trivial    |
| 3   | ViewModel.swift:200 — DateFormatter without timezone | 🟢 Medium   | Small      |

The compact table keeps the two most actionable columns (Urgency + Fix Effort). Full ratings are in the report file.

```markdown
Use the Issue Rating scale:

- **Urgency:** 🔴 CRITICAL (crash/data loss) · 🟡 HIGH (incorrect behavior) · 🟢 MEDIUM (degraded UX) · ⚪ LOW (cosmetic/minor)
- **Risk: Fix:** Risk of the fix introducing regressions (⚪ Low for isolated changes, 🟡 High for shared code paths)
- **Risk: No Fix:** User-facing consequence if left unfixed
- **ROI:** 🟠 Excellent · 🟢 Good · 🟡 Marginal · 🔴 Poor
- **Blast Radius:** Number of files the fix touches (e.g., "⚪ 1 file", "🟢 3 files", "🟡 12 files"). Count by grepping for callers/references before rating.
- **Fix Effort:** Trivial / Small / Medium / Large
```

### 1. [File:Line] — [Brief Description]

**Lens:** [Which lens found this]
**Assumption:** [What the code assumes]
**Violation scenario:** [How a real user triggers this]
**Consequence:** [What happens — crash, data loss, wrong UI, etc.]

**Current code:**

```swift
// problematic code
```

```

### 2. [File:Line] — [Brief Description]

...

## Already Guarded (Reference)

These were flagged by search but are correctly handled:

- file.swift:123 — [why it's OK]

## Needs Human Review

These findings require domain knowledge to classify:

- file.swift:456 — [what's unclear and why]

```

---

## Step 5: Follow-up

```

AskUserQuestion with questions:
[
{
"question": "How would you like to proceed?",
"header": "Next",
"options": [
{"label": "Fix all bugs now", "description": "Walk through each BUG finding and apply fixes (phase-by-phase)"},
{"label": "Fix selected bugs", "description": "I'll choose which ones to fix"},
{"label": "Create implementation plan", "description": "Generate a phased plan from the findings"},
{"label": "Report is sufficient", "description": "I'll handle fixes manually"}
],
"multiSelect": false
}
]

```

If creating plan: Group findings by file proximity and dependency, order by urgency, output as a numbered plan.

### Fix Workflow: "Fix all bugs now"

Group bugs into phases by file proximity and dependency (as in the report's Implementation Plan). Before each phase, prompt with a **phase gate** — one question, always includes opt-out:

```

AskUserQuestion with questions:
[
{
"question": "Phase N: [Phase name] ([count] fixes — [key files]). Proceed?",
"header": "Phase N",
"options": [
{"label": "Proceed (Recommended)", "description": "Implement this phase now"},
{"label": "Proceed — skip remaining phase gates", "description": "Batch mode: implement all remaining phases without prompting"},
{"label": "Let's chat about this phase", "description": "Discuss before deciding"},
{"label": "Stop here", "description": "Skip remaining phases"}
],
"multiSelect": false
}
]

```

**Every phase gets this same prompt** (including the opt-out) until the user either completes all phases or opts out.

**Rules:**
- If user chooses "skip remaining phase gates": execute all remaining phases without prompting
- If user chooses "Let's chat": wait for user input, answer questions, then re-prompt the same phase gate
- If user chooses "Stop here": stop fixing and report what was completed
- Always build both platforms after each phase to verify

### Fix Workflow: "Fix selected bugs"

Present the bug list for selection:

```

AskUserQuestion with questions:
[
{
"question": "Which bugs should I fix? (Reference the Issue Rating Table above)",
"header": "Select",
"options": [
{"label": "Bug 1 — [brief description]", "description": "[Urgency] [Fix Effort]"},
{"label": "Bug 2 — [brief description]", "description": "[Urgency] [Fix Effort]"},
{"label": "Bug 3 — [brief description]", "description": "[Urgency] [Fix Effort]"}
],
"multiSelect": true
}
]

```

After selection, one confirmation prompt with opt-out:

```

AskUserQuestion with questions:
[
{
"question": "Fix [N] selected bugs: [brief list]. Proceed?",
"header": "Confirm",
"options": [
{"label": "Proceed (Recommended)", "description": "Fix all selected bugs now"},
{"label": "Let's chat first", "description": "Discuss specific bugs before fixing"},
{"label": "Go back", "description": "Re-select bugs"}
],
"multiSelect": false
}
]

```

Then fix all selected bugs without per-bug prompting — the selection itself was the decision.

**If user chooses "Let's chat":** Answer questions, then re-prompt the confirmation.

## Lens Selection Guide

| Situation | Recommended Lenses |
|-----------|--------------------|
| Pre-release audit | All 7 |
| After adding a new feature | 1 (Assumptions) + 2 (State) + 5 (Errors) |
| After a crash report | 3 (Boundaries) + 5 (Errors) + 7 (Platform) |
| Debugging intermittent failures | 2 (State) + 6 (Time) |
| New platform support (macOS/iPad) | 7 (Platform) + 3 (Boundaries) |
| Data model changes | 4 (Data Lifecycle) + 1 (Assumptions) |
| Performance investigation | 3 (Boundaries) + 6 (Time) |

---

## What This Finds vs. What Auditors Find

| Auditors Find | Bug Prospector Finds |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Missing `@MainActor` | State machine deadlocks |
| Force unwraps | Assumptions that hold today but break tomorrow |
| Retain cycles | Data that's created but never cleaned up |
| Missing `try?` conversion | Error paths that leave UI in loading state |
| Deprecated API usage | Code that works on Apple Silicon but fails on Intel |
| Missing accessibility labels | Rapid-tap scenarios that create duplicate data |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Too many findings | Narrow scope to specific files or use "Quick 3" lenses |
| All findings are theoretical | Increase the realism threshold — only flag scenarios a real user could trigger |
| Overlapping with auditor findings | Focus on *why* not *what* — auditors find the pattern, prospector finds the consequence |
| File too complex to analyze | Split analysis by MARK sections or extract to Agent subprocesses |
| Can't determine if guarded | Classify as REVIEW, not BUG — let the human decide |
```
