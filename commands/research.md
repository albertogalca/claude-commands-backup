description: Research codebase and external docs with parallel analysis

# Research Topic

Research a topic using codebase analysis and external documentation. If $ARGUMENTS provided, focus on those areas.

## Approach

First, ask me what I need:
- Internal codebase understanding?
- External documentation/best practices?
- Both?

## Process

1. **Gather information in parallel**:
   - Search codebase for relevant files and implementations
   - Search external docs, best practices, and comparisons
   - Analyze both sources simultaneously

2. **Analyze findings**:
   - **Codebase**: How it currently works, specific file:line references, patterns used, architectural decisions
   - **External**: Key concepts, best practices, examples, common pitfalls, doc links
   - **Gap analysis**: Current state vs recommended approach, trade-offs, options

3. **Present results**:
   - High-level overview
   - Detailed findings with specific references (file:line for code, URLs for docs)
   - Patterns and conventions found
   - Actionable recommendations with trade-offs

## Output

Focus on synthesis and actionable recommendations, not raw data dumps. Include version-specific information when relevant.
